# JavaGettingStarted
## Accompanying exercises for Intro to Java for New Engineers learning path

### Prerequisites for this Learning Path
* To follow this learning path, first make sure you have a PluralSight subscription
* Make sure you have set up a GitHub account using your Principal ID under the [Principal USIS Organization](https://github.com/principalusis)
* Install either IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate, IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition, or Visual Studio Code on your local system
* Install Gradle on your local system using [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/), [PowerShell](https://chocolatey.org/install), or from the [Gradle Website](https://gradle.org/install/)

### Exercise Instructions
* Implement each of the tests one at a time, top down
* Each of the tests in the exercise files will have a @Disabled attribute that must be deleted before that test will run.
* Remove these only as you as you begin working on a new test...do NOT remove all of them at once
* Think about what the tests are in this order and be prepared to discuss it during Office Hours.  There will also be places in the code where you will be asked to answer a question or explain why you did something
* Make sure you commit each change you make as soon as the test you are working on passes so we can look at your progression through the exercise and discuss why you made those choices 

### PluralSight Curriculum
  * Week One
    * Preliminary step
      * Navigate to your [PluralSight Home Page](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/) and select "Role IQ"
