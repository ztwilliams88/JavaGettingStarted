     * We can briefly summarize the scoring rules for bowling:
     * Each game, or line of bowling, includes ten turns, or frames for the bowler.
     *
     *  In each frame, the bowler gets up to two tries to knock down all the pins.
     *
     * Open frame
     * If in two tries, they fail to knock them all down, this is called an "open frame"
     * the score for that frame is the sum of pins knocked down.
     *
     * Spare
     * If in two rolls they knocks them all down, this is called a "spare" and
     * the score for the frame is ten plus the next roll.
     *
     * Strike
     * If on the first roll in a frame all ten pins are knocked down, this is called a "strike" and
     * the score for the frame is ten plus the total of the next two rolls.
     *
     * The game score is the sum of all frame scores.
